### Minecraft modding

Minecraft modding benefits from having the original Minecraft and Minecraft Forge / Fabric / ... source code available (deobfuscated and decompiled)

In the case of Minecraft modding with Forge, a few new READ-ONLY folders would be available in the top of the treeview, each with a dedicated icon (e.g. Java icon, Minecraft icon, Forge icon)
